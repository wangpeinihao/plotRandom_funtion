## PlotRandom.R
##
## Purpose:
##    A function that will generate a random sample
##     of Normal values, plot a histogram with an 
##     overlaid mean on the plot.
##
## Inputs:
##     numpts = the number of points to generate
##     mu = the theoretical mean of the Normal distribution
##     sigma = the standard deviation of the Normal distribution
##     numbins = the number of bins for the histogram
##     meanColor = the color for the overlaid mean
##     seed = a random number generator seed, to ensure
##            reproducibility
## Outputs: A list with the following elements
##     Random_values = a vector with the generated random 
##                     values
##     Mean_x = the sample mean of Random_values
##     SD_x = the sample standard deviation of Random_values
